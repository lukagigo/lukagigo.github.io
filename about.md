Hello! I’m Luka Gigović and I’m a 24 year old graphic and typeface designer from Slovenia. Currently I’m finishing my thesis on graphic and interactive communications at Faculty of Natural Science and Engineering in Ljubljana where I fell in love with letters and became obsessed with them ever since. Mostly I enjoy working on projects where typography, sports and bold colours take part together.
