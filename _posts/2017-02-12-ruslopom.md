This project shows us the development and design of a visual identity for the Ruslopom company, that specialises in translation, interpretation and organisation of language courses. It offers professional aid in communication between Russian, Slovenian and English, in all directions, therefore working through six different channels. The client wished to have a flexible logo that represents the essence of his work – the transformation of these three languages, in colours, that are typical for countries where people speak these languages. The challenge was even more interesting, as trilinguality presupposes that the logo has to include an option of different subscripts.

We have created a story of three interconnected bridges that form a synonym for accessibility between two otherwise inaccessible parts. The union of three parts creates a dynamical form, without a beginning and without an end that represents communication. Each part is split in half by a thin line, which makes the logo look like a flag and offers many colour variables (it opens up space for adding new, additional languages).

Special attention was given to the selection of typography, since we wished to have a font family that is akin to the shapes of the logo, is reader-friendly and offers quality messaging at low quality. The conditions were the following: twisted footing of the "R", similarities between the endings and the logo, as well as open expressionistic forms that communicate between each other. The humanistic font family Merriweather fits these conditions and also offers support in Cyrillic script. We have created a system that subjects the logo to the language. The subscripts are made in a Serif version of writing, in order to create a combination of modernity and antiquity of the written language. The name of the company – Ruslopom – has narrow gaps in order to fasten up the rhythm of the main word. "R" is written as an uppercase letter, while the remaining letters are in lower case, which allows us to balance and connect the abstract form with the text.
